SALES TAXES
Written By: Kevin Yang
Programming Platform: IntelliJ

At first I wanted to use javac to build the project, but the instructions in the interview mentioned IntelliJ or Eclipse so I went with IntelliJ.

Unit tests in the same directory as class files

non taxed items are listed in notax.txt, therefore do not use plural case for items, unless the plural case is also added into the file
input must use base price regardless of qty

Input orders line by line
Print receipt with ctrl-d
